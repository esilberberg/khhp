                <p>KHHP is primarily an index of information sources documenting the history, culture, and achievements of people of Hispanic descent living in Kentucky. On the <a href="sources.html">Sources</a> page, users can find references to news articles, academic research, reports, oral histories, other audio content, and blog posts.</p>

            <button class="help-accordion" id="button-2">How do I search for sources in KHHP?</button>
            <div class="help-accordion-panel">
                <p>Go to the <a href="sources.html">Sources</a> page, select a Source Type from the drop-down menu to the left of the search box (optional), enter a keyword in the search box, and click the magnifying glass icon to the right. Results that meet your search criteria will display in a list. You can read details about each source in the entry and click the down arrow to display more information. By clicking on a Subject, Source Type, or Languages, you can view all sources of that kind.</p>

            <button class="help-accordion" id="button-3">How can I access the sources I find on KHHP?</button>
            <div class="help-accordion-panel">
                <p>Unfortunately, due to copyright restrictions, KHHP cannot provide direct access to the full text of every source. Wherever possible, a link is provided in the source entry. In most cases, that link goes to a bibliographic record in InfoKat, a library database at the University of Kentucky. If you are affiliated with the University of Kentucky, you can access content by clicking the full text link in those records. Community members who are not affiliated with the University of Kentucky can use the available bibliographic details to request the source from their local public library. If you need help accessing a particular source, please contact the KHHP development team at the following email: info@khhp.org.</p>

            <button class="help-accordion" id="button-4">What details are available for each source?</button>
            <div class="help-accordion-panel">
                <p>Each source is categorized by Source Type and Subjects. Source Types include: Audio; Event, Creative; Images; Journalism; Reports; Research; Transcript; Video; and Website. Subjects are assigned to further describe the nature of the source, the geographic area(s) it covers, and the topics it addresses.

            <button class="help-accordion" id="button-5">What are “Stories”?</button>
            <div class="help-accordion-panel">
                <p>Go to the Stories page to find content produced and created by KHHP program collaborators. This page features oral history projects directed by Drs. Yanira Paz and Taylor Leigh, and stored through the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History. You will also find links to the KHHP Blog, which presents articles and annotated bibliographies that explore topics using the sources from the KHHP collection. The blog is managed by Dr. Ruth Brown and includes posts written by the KHHP development team, University of Kentucky students, and others.</p>
