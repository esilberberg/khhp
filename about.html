                <p>The mission of the Kentucky Hispanic Heritage Project (KHHP) is to maintain a digital space dedicated to the history, culture, achievements, and contemporary experience of people of Hispanic descent living in Kentucky and, by doing so, to advance understanding and promote education about this population. To achieve this mission, KHHP presents multimodal and multimedia data in a user-friendly interface that allows visitors to browse content as well as locate specific data efficiently. KHHP content spans qualitative and quantitative data, academic research, news and press coverage, oral history interviews, community organization information, original creative works, cultural events, and relevant public/private initiatives.</p>
                <p>The project began in Fall 2021 as a collaboration between three faculty members from the University of Kentucky: Ruth Brown and Yanira Paz from the Department of Hispanic Studies and Taylor Leigh from UK Libraries. Our initial goal was to create a website to consolidate our existing research and oral history projects, each of which focused in some way on the history and culture of Hispanic peoples and communities in Kentucky.</p>
                <p>Currently, the project is focused on developing this website as a digital space to collect, preserve, and share existing written, visual, and audio sources that document and celebrate the histories and cultures of Hispanic people and communities in Kentucky. In the future, we hope to provide information about and help promote cultural activities and events in the community, relevant public/private initiatives and organizations, and to also develop new oral history, research, and creative projects.</p>
                <p>To help grow the site and better represent the diverse experiences and histories of Hispanic peoples and communities in Kentucky, we welcome community contributions in the form of short blog articles, research, video content, oral histories, visual art, and other original works. For more information about contributing authors and artists please visit the Contributors page.</p>
