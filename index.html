            <p>This website provides information on existing written, visual, and audio sources that document the history, culture, and achievements of people of Hispanic descent living in Kentucky. Users can choose to browse materials by source type, language of publication, or enter keywords to tailor the search to their interests. Hyperlinks lead users directly to open-access sources as available, and to the University of Kentucky Librariesâ€™ catalogue record as needed for periodical, print, and online journals. The website and search are fully bilingual, allowing users to explore in either English or Spanish.</p>
            <p>The majority of the sources have been identified through thematic searches of materials that are either published online or indexed through online databases. As the project grows, we hope to include a greater variety of source types, wider geographic representation, Spanish-language publications and information on current events, all with the goal of making the information presented in our collection as representative of the history, culture, and geographic distribution of Hispanic communities in Kentucky as possible. While you might not find what you are looking for on this visit, please check back with us! We regularly add new sources and hope that over time our collection will support a variety of interests, from personal curiosity to cultural programming, research, and beyond.</p>
